# Deliverables: Wk 4


## Queue



We also added the audio processing to the queue. This makes it painless to add new songs to the app---just upload them to the repo, paste the name and link into the app file, and they will show up, ready to play. 
This is possible because of libraries like numpy and scipy that are optimized to handle large data matrices, which allow a whole song to be analyzed in about ~3-6 seconds. 
Whenever the button is pressed to add a song to the queue, it runs the script to generate the beat and frequency information from the appropriate audio file, 
and then sends this to the central server along with the other song info to be parsed and stored in the database. 
The user sees the little loading symbol while the audio processes, and then receives visual confirmation that their song was successfully submitted to the queue.
