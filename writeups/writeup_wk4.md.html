### Queue Implementation

The queue was implemented by augmenting the room database with an additional timestamp parameter. 
When a user adds an event to the queue, it adds another “room” to the database table storing the information about the room. 
To get the currently playing song, you just query the server for the oldest song in the queue.

The problem quickly arose, however, that we would need to remove the old items from the queue when a song was finished. 
This was easy enough, as we simply had to send a request to pop the oldest item out of the database when a song was finished. 
The issue is that if multiple users are listening, then multiple songs are popped off of the end of the database as each client sends the same pop request. 
To accommodate for this, we stored the timestamp of the last time a pop request was made and require a buffer of at least 3 seconds before pop requests. 
This is implemented in the following code snippet:

```python
reference = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(seconds=2)

with open('/var/jail/home/team00/final/pop_memory.txt', 'r') as f:
    time = datetime.datetime.strptime(f.read(), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f')

    if time < reference:
        pop_song(request['values']['room'])  # remove top song
        set_user_room_attr(request['values']['room'], 'song_changed', 1)
        with open('/var/jail/home/team00/final/pop_memory.txt', 'w') as f:
            f.write(str(datetime.datetime.now()))
```

We also added the audio processing to the queue. This makes it painless to add new songs to the app---just upload them to the repo, paste the name and link into the app file, and they will show up, ready to play. 
This is possible because of libraries like numpy and scipy that are optimized to handle large data matrices. 
Using these tools, a whole song to be analyzed in about ~3-6 seconds, and ideally, using the queue effectively, this occurs while one of the previous songs are playing. 
Whenever the button is pressed to add a song to the queue, it runs the script to generate the beat and frequency information from the appropriate audio file, 
and then sends this to the central server along with the other song info to be parsed and stored in the database. 
The user sees the little loading symbol while the audio processes, and then receives visual confirmation that their song was successfully submitted to the queue.

## Multiple LED patterns with frequency/beat integration

Last week, we implemented a basic FSM framework that allows the LEDs to be integrated with frequency and beat data. 
As a reminder,the state machine is structured as follows:
	- **IDLE** state: FSM begins here, as an initial point before immediately transitioning to the COLOR state.
	- **COLOR** state: determine the color to switch the LED light(s) to, by extracting the correct frequency value from the notes array. Switch to the RETAIN state.
	- **RETAIN** state: In the case of the "chase" pattern, first determine which LED lights to update. Retain the color on the LED light(s) for the appropriate duration of time as specified in the timestamp[] array, unless the end of the song has been reached. Switch to the COLOR state to repeat the LED update process.

From this fundamental FSM structure, we implemented four unique types of patterns that would adapt to the current song's beats AND/OR frequency:
* **WAVES**: This pattern sends "waves" of colors darting across the LED strip at constant speed; the effect is achievable by commanding certain LED lights (indices returned from a sine-wave function) to turn on, and then fade at a certain rate.
		The colors shown correspond to the real-time frequency of the current note in the song. To clarify the colors and for better visual effect, we implemented the pattern to send two distinct waves (of the same color) with contrasting offsets, across a white background of LEDs. 
		This pattern does not correlate with the beat changes of the song; if a wave is sent at every note change (or even at every few note changes), the lights would be darting too quickly back and forth across the LED for it to be visually pleasing.
		Instead, the user would be able to specify if they want a "Fast Wave" or a "Slow Wave" pattern.
* **GRADIENTS**: This pattern is similar to the Wave in that it sends a moving window of colors across the LED strip; but here, the window moves with a speed proportional to the song's speed.  
		This effect is achievable by manipulating the a "Palette" functionality in FastLED. We specified a palette of colors to feed into the FSM, and upon every switch of notes, the LED would display a shifted subset of the palette; over time, this would appear as the gradient "moving" across the LED.
		Since this pattern does not integrate the frequency data, We similarly gave the user the option to see a gradient of warmer colors ("Sun Gradient") or cooler colors ("Moon Gradient").
* **SPARKLES**: This pattern uses both beat and frequency data. Upon each change of beat, it turns on a randomly selected LED light with a color corresponding to the current note's frequency. To achieve a continuous visual effect, We faded each turned-on LED by constant amounts at each loop, so that the LED strip as a whole has a natural sparkly look.
* **PULSES**: This pattern also uses both beat and frequency data.  Upon each change of beat, it turns on all LED lights with a color corresponding to the current note's frequency. 
		To achieve a continuous visual effect (i.e. make it look less like a series of discrete flashes), We used the "blend" functionality on the FastLED library, where a new color is not immediately "flashed" in replacement of the previous one, but rather blended with the preexisting color.
		Between the timespan of two notes with different frequencies, the LEDs would cycle within a blended range of the two notes' corresponding colors, creating a smooth and continuous look.
