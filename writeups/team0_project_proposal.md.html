**Digital Disco Project Proposal**

The pandemic has put a pause on parties. Zoom parties can fill part of this need, but are lacking in atmosphere and experience. At a real party, you would blast pumped up music in a matching energetic environment, but this isn’t the case online. We aim to solve this pressing problem with our project, “Digital Disco.”

The Digital Disco is a smart lighting system that you can easily install in your room to take your virtual parties to the next level. Paired with our handy web application, your lights will auto-magically sync to the music you play on your computer speakers, which in turn will be synced with the music your friends play. 

This syncing can take on different user defined forms (toggled via buttons on the user’s ESP32 light controller), including based on dominant frequency or by syncing to the beats. When there is no audio playing, the ESP32 will consistently query a web server to gather information pertaining to the lighting sequence it should play when the music starts.

# Intended functionality

## Description

On the web app, users will be able to join or create rooms. In the room, users may add songs to a queue. The server will process the audio files from songs on the queue and generate a light-flashing sequence based on the characteristics of the song. When a song moves to the top of the queue and the processing has been completed, the ESP32 and server will communicate to start playing the audio with the light sequence.

# Technical challenges

One technical challenge that may be a recurring theme is the question: how does one sync multiple pieces of media across different devices? We are attempting to begin solving the lights-audio issue by picking up the music in a microphone on the ESP. This way, it is synced to the user’s local audio, and not *also* dependent on latency between the user’s computer and the central server. However, our original design for this recognition is not very robust, in part because music varies widely, and we would expect that having a more definitive recognition system would take a lot more sampling time, thus derailing the synchronization effort. I think the emphasis on this system has to be precision in time in order to produce the desired effect on the user, though various testing to determine the tradeoffs must be done. 
On the larger scale, there is also the question of synchronizing the whole system between different users in the same “listening room.” This requires less precision, however, the better it can be, the better the user experience. 

Other technical challenges are aspects which fall outside the direct content of this course, such as the signal processing. 6.003 gives a good foundation to work from, but its focus is often more theoretical and less on applications/trouble-shooting so there will definitely be lots to learn here. 

Additionally, another challenge will be the ability to scale so that the server can correctly handle multiple rooms at once, all with the potential to hold multiple users. How will this data be organized and structured? How can the server do the signal processing it needs to in an efficient way so that it does not block calls? What processes for different rooms need to happen in parallel and how can this be achieved?

# Work division

When we started fleshing out the idea for this project, we tried to consider a work division that would play to people’s strengths. For example, Raunak’s main task will be handling the web app, since he has prior experience with this. Alyssa’s main focus will be on the signal processing, since she is taking 6.003 this semester. Sunmee and Karen will focus on the ESP-side work, including getting the LEDs functioning, and integration of the system as a whole. 
We tried to portion out the milestones with this in mind, giving everyone something to do each week within their wheelhouse.
